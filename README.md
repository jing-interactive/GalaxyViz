Stars
=============

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/paulhoux/Cinder-Samples/master/Stars/PREVIEW.png)


This very elaborate sample will show you how to:
* render advanced, animated point sprites using shaders
* construct VBO meshes that are not GL_TRIANGLES like TriMesh
* use the IrrKlang sound engine to play sound effects and music
* use the CameraStereo class to render in stereoscopic 3D (side-by-side)
* perform cylindrical projection using a frame buffer and a special fragment shader
* create your own camera class that can be animated or controlled by the user
* read and parse a text file containing data
* read and write a binary data file for faster loading


Note: for the sample to play music, add MP3, WAV, OGG and/or FLAC files to the <i>./assets/music</i> folder.
